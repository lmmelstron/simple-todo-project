# Simple todo app

Simple porject that uses required libraries and my understanding of them. SPA allows you to add todos, change their status and filter them by it.

No persistance, editing or clearing completed todos (might add later..)

## Libs

Vite, React, ts, mobx, sass, css modules, vitest, testing-library.

## Instalation

npm install && npm run start
